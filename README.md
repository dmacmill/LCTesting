A quick jot-down of the Palindromic Substring problem from leetcode to demonstrate C# knowledge.

Longest Palindrominc Substring

given: a string s with len 1 <= s.Length <= 1000
 
find the longest palindrome within the string. return as a string.

>e.g. LongestPalindrome("abba") = "abba"
>
>LongestPalindrome("gabba") = "abba"
>
>LongestPalindrome("massachusetts") = "ss" or "tt"
>
>LongestPalindrome("hi") = "h" or "i"

Naive approach was what I arrived at, and the 2D approach was found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindromic-substring/#using-dynamic-programming
